# Ember.js Plugin

This plugin provides build time compilation for [Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js) handlebar templates.

# How to install

* play 2.1.0:

```
addSbtPlugin("com.ketalo.play.plugins" % "emberjs" % "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT")
``` 

You may need to add a reference to Sonatype repository
```
resolvers += "Sonatype snapshots" at "http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/"
```

to your plugin.sbt

# How to Use

* Select your ember version in your Build.scala. Currently support versions include 1.0.0-rc.3, 1.0.0-rc.1 and 1.0.0-pre.2

```scala
  import com.ketalo.EmberJsKeys
  import sbt._

  object ApplicationBuild extends Build with EmberJsKeys {

    val appName         = "play-emberjs-sample"
    val appVersion      = "1.0-SNAPSHOT"

    val appDependencies = Seq.empty

    val main = play.Project(appName, appVersion, appDependencies).settings(
      emberJsVersion := "1.0.0-rc.3"
    )

  }
```

* Include ember.js and the corresponding jQuery and handlebars files. Note that they are not provided by the sbt plugin. Check the ember site for them: [ember.js](https://ember.js) 
```html
    <script src="@routes.Assets.at("javascripts/jquery-1.8.2.min.js")" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="@routes.Assets.at("javascripts/handlebars-1.0.rc.3.js")" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="@routes.Assets.at("javascripts/ember-1.0.0-rc.3.js")" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

* Put your handlebar template (.handlebars) files under the ```app/assets/templates``` directory

* Reference the generated .js in a  ```<script>``` tag:
```
<script src="@routes.Assets.at("templates/templates.pre.js")"></script>
```

The templates.pre.js file generates a javascript containing all the templates in that directory

# Sample

For an example, see the bundled sample app for three different ember versions

* [ember 1.0.0-rc.3](/sample-1.0.0-rc.3)
* [ember 1.0.0-rc.1](/sample-1.0.0-rc.1)
* [ember 1.0.0-pre.2](/sample-1.0.0-pre.2)
