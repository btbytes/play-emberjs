# Ember.js Plugin

This plugin provides build time compilation for [Ember.js/handlebars](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js) templates.

# How to install

* add 

play 2.1.0:

```addSbtPlugin("com.ketalo.play.plugins" % "emberjs" % "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT")``` 

to your plugin.sbt

# How to Use

* Include ember.js and the corresponding jQuery and handlebars files. Note that they are not provided by the sbt plugin. Check the ember site for them: [ember.js](https://ember.js) 
```     <script src="@routes.Assets.at("javascripts/jquery-1.8.2.min.js")" type="text/javascript"></script>
        <script src="@routes.Assets.at("javascripts/handlebars-1.0.rc.1.js")" type="text/javascript"></script>
        <script src="@routes.Assets.at("javascripts/ember-1.0.0-pre.2.js")" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

* Put your handlebar template (.handlebars) files under the ```app/assets/templates``` directory

* Reference the generated .js in a  ```<script>``` tag:
```<script src="@routes.Assets.at("templates/template.pre.js")"></script>```

The template.pre.js file generates a javascript containing all the templates in that directory
